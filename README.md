# SiliconDust HDHomeRun Proxy

Proxy for legacy SiliconDust HDHomeRun devices. This proxy sits in front of one or many HDHomeRun devices to simulate channel scanning and lineups; this negates the need to use SiliconDust's online service and Windows application for channel scanning and lineup support.

Current limitations:

* Each proxied devices requires an IP address assigned just for that devices proxy. This is due to most applications identifying HDHomeRun devices by only the device's IP address.
